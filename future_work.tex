\section{Summary \& Future Work}
\subsection{Implementation}
An implementation of the postprocessing approach for maximal planar graphs would be of interest in order to further analyze the behaviour of the edge-length ratio and have a look at the readability of the poly-line drawings with a minimized ratio.
\subsection{New drawing algorithm}
While this report covers approaches which alters either preexisting drawings or drawing algorithms, it would be of interest to create a new drawing algorithm. The input would be a planar graph described as an adjacence list and the output would be an embedding so that a drawing can be derived with a guaranteed ratio upper bound better than $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
\subsection{Further minimizations}
We observed that a linear amount of bends is mandatory for the edge-length ratio to be bound by a constant. It would be of interest to further minimize either the number of bends without losing any upper bounds or the area the whole drawing takes place in. When observing the result of the 2-trees, a similar ratio upper bound might be achieved with less area used than $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$.
