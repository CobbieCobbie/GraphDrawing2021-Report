# Research Project during my Masters

For over 25 years, an international symposium of Graph Drawing and Network Visualization takes place annually. 28th International Symposium of [Graph Drawing](http://www.graphdrawing.org/sc.html) and Network Visualization will be held from September 15th to 17th in Tübingen.

Part of the symposium is a traditional Graph Drawing Contest. The contest consists of two parts - the Creative Topics and the Live Challenge. The main focus for the Creative Topics lies on the creation of drawings of two given graphs. Aspects to consider for the visualization are clarity, aesthetic appeal and readability.

On the other hand, the Live Challenge is held similar to a programming contest. Participants, usually teams, will get a theme and a set of graphs and will have one hour of processing. The results will be ranked and the team with the highest score wins the competition. The teams will be allowed to use any combination of software and human interaction systems in order to produce the best results. Usually, the challenge is derived from a theoretical optimization problem.

On the occasion of the Graph Drawing contest held this year in Tübingen, this report covers the topic of drawing various graph classes with connections of approximately equal length.

This research project was my foundational work for my final [Masters Thesis](https://github.com/CobbieCobbie/MSc_Thesis).
