\subsection{Introductory example graphs}
\subsubsection{The first example}
Graphs that are strongly connected are of interest for the edge-length ratio. 
\subsubsection{The second example}
\subsection{ToDo}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Formalize and write down the current results
	\item For the non-maximal planar triangle graph, find the area usage for $m$ triangles. They need a quadratic amount of area.
	\item Now, triangulate the example beforehand and allow one bend. How about any optimization? What happens, when you twist any of the triangles? What happens, when you \grqq lift\grqq~ each of the inner triangles by one, allowing bends on the bottom?
\end{itemize}
